## Team Reflection

### How the team split the work
The team split the work as follows:
- **Adi** and **Alon** were responsible for backend development and writing tests.
- **Ahmad** worked on the frontend implementation.
- **Yakir**, who was on reserve duty, performed general code review.

### How and where AI tools were used
We used **Curser** to write all the parts of the code , also to assist with writing and improving test coverage. We experimented with different LLMs, and found that **Claude** gave significantly better results than **Gemini**. At some point during the test-writing process, Gemini entered an infinite loop and repeatedly responded that it was unable to complete the task. Claude, on the other hand, was more stable and effective, especially in helping us handle edge cases and debug test failures.

### Lessons learned and challenges faced
The most significant challenges were:
- Achieving high test coverage.
- Maintaining test integrity while using AI-assisted tools.
-seamless integration between the backend and the frontend component.

-We learned how to split the workload effectively as a team, and how to work with external AI APIsâ€”something that was new and interesting for most of us.
